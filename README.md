## üìù How to Use

2.  **Navigate Sections:**
    *   Click "Go to Calendar" to view your mood calendar.
    *   Click "Show Analysis" to see the mood trend graph for the currently viewed month.
    *   Use the "Back to Mood Input" buttons (available in the Calendar or Analysis sections) to return to the main input screen.
3.  **Using the Calendar:**
    *   Navigate between months using the `‚ùÆ` (Previous) and `‚ùØ` (Next) arrow buttons at the top of the calendar.
    *   **To log/update a mood for any day on the calendar:**
        1.  Ensure a mood is selected in the "Mood Input" section (it will have a blue border). You might need to go "Back to Mood Input" to pick or change your active mood.
        2.  Navigate to the "Calendar" section if you aren't there already.
        3.  Click on the desired day in the calendar:
            *   If the day is empty, the selected mood will be applied.
            *   If the day already has a mood, it will be updated to the new mood you selected in the input section.
            *   If you click a day that already has the *same* mood as the one currently selected in the input section, the mood will be *removed* from that day.
4.  **View Mood Analysis:**
    *   Click "Show Analysis". The graph displays mood trends for the month currently visible/selected in the calendar.
5.  **Reset Data:**
    *   In the Calendar section, click the "Reset All Data" button. A confirmation dialog will appear before all saved mood data is erased.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   Adding optional notes to mood entries.
*   Implementing activity/trigger tags.

*   "Year in Pixels" view.
*   Export/Import data functionality.
