# Mood Tracker Web Application

## üåü Overview

This Mood Tracker is a simple yet effective web application designed to help users log their daily moods and **optional notes** using intuitive emoji buttons. Users can visualize their emotional patterns over time through a color-coded calendar and a monthly trend graph. The app also **initializes with sample data** on first use if no prior data exists, allowing for immediate demonstration of its features.

This project was developed as a submission for the CodeCiruit Hackathon by Outlier AI.

## üìù How to Use

1.  **Log Today's Mood & Note:**
    - On the main "Mood Input" section, click the emoji that best represents your mood for the day. The selected emoji will get a blue border.
    - Once a mood is selected, an optional note input field will appear below the emojis. You can type any relevant thoughts or events here. The placeholder text in the note field will change based on the mood you selected.
    - Click the "Save Today's Mood" button. A confirmation ("Today's mood and note have been saved!") will appear. The selected mood and note input will then reset.
2.  **Navigate Sections:**
    - Click "Go to Calendar" to view your mood calendar. The main app title will hide.
    - Click "Show Analysis" to see the mood trend graph for the currently viewed month. The main app title will hide.
    - Use the "Back" buttons (available in the Calendar or Analysis sections) to return to the main "Mood Input" screen. The main app title will reappear.
3.  **Using the Calendar:**
    - The calendar section now has a "Calendar" title.
    - Navigate between months using the `‚ùÆ` (Previous) and `‚ùØ` (Next) arrow buttons at the top of the calendar.
    - Click on any day in the calendar. If a mood was logged for that day:
      - A section below the calendar will appear showing the date, the mood emoji, and any note that was saved with it.
      - If no note was saved, it will indicate that.
      - If no mood was recorded for that day, it will also indicate that.
4.  **View Mood Analysis:**
    - The analysis section now has a "Mood Analysis" title.
    - Click "Show Analysis". The graph displays mood trends for the month currently visible/selected in the calendar.
5.  **Reset Data:**
    - In the Calendar section, click the "Reset" button. A confirmation dialog will appear before all saved mood data is erased.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- **Editing notes/moods for past entries** directly from the calendar.
- Ability to log/edit moods for past/future dates directly on the calendar (not just viewing).
- Adding activity/trigger tags.
- Statistics page (e.g., most common mood, mood streaks).
- "Year in Pixels" view.
- Export/Import data functionality.
- Search/filter notes.
